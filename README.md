# Preparation

1. **Edit target.csv:** Open the `target.csv` file and enter the e-commerce websites that you are looking for. Make sure to consider the domain extensions that are applicable to the country you are searching from. For example, if you are searching from Singapore, use the `.sg` extension. Additionally, ensure that the e-commerce websites you enter are valid by conducting your own search on your preferred search engine.

```csv
#target.csv
# e.g If your vpn is set to Singapore. Ensure you put a comma after every website
amazon.sg,
shopee.sg,
.
.
.

```

# Running the Script

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. **Open main.py:** Navigate to the `main.py` file in your Visual Studio Code.
2. **Run the Script:** Run the script directly from your Visual Studio Code. You can do this by clicking the "Run" button or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut.
3. **Input country you are searching from** e.g Singapore, Malaysia.
4. Let the code run and generate your results. Do not stop the code at any point unless needed.
